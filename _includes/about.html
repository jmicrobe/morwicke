                Pablo and Jess first met online, over their shared interest for strange movies, science, and silly internet videos. They both are transplants to the Pacific Northwest from sunnier places, and love the rainy and green region they now call home along with their pet rabbit Dio.

                After getting engaged at Halloween Horror Nights, they have been eagerly planning their wedding to celebrate their union and love of dark things, and hope that their close friends and family can join them.
