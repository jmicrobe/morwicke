                Pablo and Jess first met online, over their shared interest for strange movies, science, and silly internet videos. They both are transplants to the Pacific Northwest from sunnier places, and love the rainy and green region they now call home.
                <br>
                After getting engaged at Halloween Horror Nights, they have been eagerly planning their wedding to celebrate their union and love of dark things, and hope that their close friends and family can join them.
                <br>
                The wedding schedule is currently TBD however guests should plan on the early afternoon of October 19th, 2019 for the ceremony, followed by a delicious feast. A rehersal dinner with family will occur in the evening prior, on October 18th.
